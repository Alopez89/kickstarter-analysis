Using excel to analyze kickstarter campaigns to find trends and find out of what works and what didnt ccA
# Analysis and Challenges 
On this project I used Microsoft Excel as the only tool to analyze raw numbers and determine outcomes. The functions that were used were "Average", "VLookup", "Countifs", and "Sum". The data was properly organized, howver if it was then the possibility of errors in the functions, and ultimately conclusions, is highly likely.
# Conclustions
 Based off of the analysis that I ran I can conclude that plays that are set for the summer (May, June, July) had the highest success rates. Also, Plays that were under $5,000 had the highest success rates while plays between $25,000 - $35,000 had less than a 30% chance of succeeding.
